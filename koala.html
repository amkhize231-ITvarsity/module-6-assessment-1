                     <h3>KOALA</h3>
                  <P>tHE koala or, inaccrately,kola bear(Phascolarctos cinereus) is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant representativeof the family Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are the wombts, which are members of the family Vombatidae.The koala is found in coastal area of the mainland's eaststern and southern regions, inhabiting Queensland,new south wales, Victoria,and South Australia.It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large heard with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shpenose</P><p>The Koala has a body length of 60-85 cm(9-33in )and weighs4-15kg(9-33Ib). Fur colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown.Koalas from the northen populatoins are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their countrparts further south. These populations possibly are separated subspecies</p>
                 
                     <p>The world koala comes from the Dharug gula,meaning no water.it was at one time thought, since the animals were not observed to come down from trees often, that they were able to survive without drinking.The leaves of the eucalpt tree have high water content so the koala does not need to drink water at all was shown to be a myth. Although the vowel 'u' was originally written in the english orthography as"oo"(in spellings such as coola or koolah), it was changed to "oa" possibly in error.</p>
