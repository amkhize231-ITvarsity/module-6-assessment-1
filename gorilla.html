                     <h3>GOLLIRA</h3>
                  <P>Gorilla are ground-dwelling predominantly herbivorous apes that inhabit the forest of central sub-saharan Africa. The genus gorilla is divided into two species:the eastern gorilla and the western gorillas(both critically endangered),and either four or five subspecies. They are the largest living primates. The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans, from 95 to 99%depending on what is included, and they are the next closest living relatives to humans after the chimpanzees and bonobos.</P><p>Gorillas natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forest in sub-saharan africa. Although their range cover a wide range of elevations. The mountain gorilla inhabits the Albertine Rift montane cloud forest of the virunga volcanoes, ranging in altitude from 2,200 to 4,300 metres(7200 to 14,100 ft). </p>
                 
                     <p>Lowland gorillas live  in dense forests and lowland swamps and maeshes as low as sea level,with western lowland gorillas living in central west Africa countries and eastern lowland gorilla living in the democratic republic of the congo near its border with rwanda.</p><p>A gorilla's day is divided between rest periods and travel or feeding periods. diets differ between and within species. mountain gorilla mostly eat foliage such as leaves, very small part of their diets. mountain gorilla food is widely distribured and neither individuals nor groups have to compete with one another. their home ranges vary from 3 to 15km^2(1.16 to 5.79 mi^2) and their movements range around 500 m(0.31 mi) or less on an averange day. Despite eating a few species in each habitat, mountain gorillas have flexible diets and can live in variety of habitats</p>
