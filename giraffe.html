                     <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                  <P>The giraffe(Giraffa) is an African artiodacty mammal, the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant.It is traditionally considered to be one species, Giraffa comelopardalis, with nine subspecies. However, the existence of up to eight extant giraffe species has been described,based upon research into the mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements of Giraffa. seven other species are extinct, prehistiric species known from fossils</P><p>Giraffes are usually found in groups that vary in size and composition according to ecological, anthropogenic, temporal, and social factors. Traditionally, the composition of these groups had been described as open and ever-changing. For research purposes, a"group"has been defined as "a collection of individuals that are less than a kilometere apart and moving in the same general direction." More recent studies have found that giraffes have long term social associations and may form groups or pairs based on kinship,sex or other factors, and these groups regulary associated with one another in larger communities or sub-commumoties within a fission-fusion society.The number of giraffes in a group can range from 1 up to 66 individuals.</p>
                 
                     <p>Giraffe belongs in HERBIVOUS IN THE FOOD CHAIN.The giraffe is classified as a consumer in the food chain, meaning that it only eat plants and not other animals. The giraffes mainly gaze on the twigs of trees, preferring the Mimosa tree's plant The giraffe will occasionally eat bugs such as acacia bugs and other fly-like animals.</p>
