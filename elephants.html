                     <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                     <p>Elephants are mammals of the family Elephantidae and the largest existing land animals. three species are currently recognised:the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; extinct members include the mastodons. the fimaly Elephantidae also contain several now extinct groups, including the mammoths and straight-tusked elephant. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, and whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears, and convex or level backs. distive features of all elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusk, large ears flaps, massive legs and tough but sensitive skin. the trunk is used for breathing ,breathing food and water to the mouth, and grasping objects. tusks which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body tempurature as well as in communication. the pillar-like legs carry their great weight.</p><p>Elephants are scattered throught sub-Sahra Africa, SOUTH Africa Asia, and Southeast Asia and are found in different habitats, including savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes. They are considered to be keysrtone species, due to their impact on their impact on their enviroments. Elephants have a fission-fusion society, in which multiple family groups come together to socialise. female(cows) tend to live in family groups, which can cinsist if one female with her calves or serveral related females with offspring. The group, which do not include bulls are led by the (usually) oldest cow, known as the matriarch.</p>
                     
                     <p>Elephants are herbivorous and will eat leaves, twigs, fruits, grass and roots. Elephants have the largest teeth on earth larger than whales. The loss of teeth contribute to or is the leading cause of death of mature elephant .As the final molar breks it becomes ever difficult to chew food and this may couse starvation and malnutrition.</p><p>The average African elephants tusk can reach 1.5 to 2.4 meters and may weight in at 23 to 45 kg. The trunk is in actual fact a limb and has an estimated 100 000 muscles and tendons. Incredible elephants like humans are left or right handed as they will favor using one side from the other(Tusk)</p>
