The term is applied descriptively to group of primate,such as families of new world monkeys and old world. many monkey species are tree-dwelling(arboreal),although there are species that live primarily on the ground,such as baboons.most species are mainly active during the day(diurnal).monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent especially the old world monkey of catarrhini.</P><p>Simians and tarsiers emerged within haplorrhines some 60 million years ago.new world monkeys and catacatarrhine monkeyes emerged within the simians some 35 million years ago.old world monkeys and hominoidea emerged within the catarrhine monkeys some 25 million years ago.Extinct basal simians such as Aegyptopithecus or Parapithecus[35-32 million years ago],eosimiidea and sometimes even the catarrhini group are also considered monkeys by primatologists</p>
                 
                     <p>Capuchin monkeys are onmivorous(species that eat both plant and animals as their primary food source)feeding on fruits,nuts and seeds as well as insects spiders,birdseggs and small vertebrates.They may even occasionally feede on small vertabrates,such as lizards and birders chicks.
